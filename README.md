# Protein-Folding

Version 1.0 - Generates a protein (modeled as a chain of monomers) and moves randomly selected amino acids (nodes of the protein chain) at random. The links between the node that is to be moved must not be "stretched" (made greater than one), and only one monomer may occupy a single point on the lattice at any one time. If these conditions cannot be met, the monomer will not be moved.
