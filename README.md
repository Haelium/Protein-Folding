# Protein-Folding

Protein-Folding is a collection of scripts and functions written to reproduce and expand upon results from Chapter 12 of "Computational Physics 2nd Edition" by N. Giordano and H. Nakanishi.

Ultimately the protein should be modelled as a cubic lattice and the code should be optimised to run on a cluster.

The scripts named analyse* set the initial conditions such as protein length, number of monte carlo steps, monomer interaction energies and temperature for the simulation. These scripts may take values over a range of values of length, temperature and other values.
