# Protein-Folding

Protein-Folding is a collection of scripts and functions written to reproduce and enhance results from Chapter 12 of "Computational Physics 2nd Edition" by N. Giordana and H. Nakanishi.

The scripts named analyse* set the initial conditions such as protein length, number of monte carlo steps, monomer interaction energies and temperature for the simulation. These scripts may take values over a range of values of length, temperature and other values.
